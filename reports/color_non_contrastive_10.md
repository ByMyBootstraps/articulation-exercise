What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) The rule seems to be: if the text contains a numerical value, then it is marked as True. However, this hypothesis does not perfectly match all the examples, as there are instances with numerical references that were marked False. A more accurate hypothesis might be: if the text contains a numerical value and it's quoted from an old religious or historical text, like the Bible or a church record, then
1) The rule seems to be that the sentence or paragraph is marked as True if it contains numerical information or specific measurements and False if it does not.
2) My hypothesis for the rule is: a statement is tagged as True if it introduces specific quantities or numbers in its narrative, otherwise it's tagged as False.
3) The rule seems to be that the output is True when the input text includes numbers. If the input text doesn't contain any numbers the output is False.
4) The rule seems to be that sentences containing numbers are classified as True. All sentences that do not contain numbers are classified as False.
5) The rule seems to be that any input that contains a numerical value (whether it is a written number or in digit form) results in a 'True' output. Inputs without any numerical values give 'False' outputs.
