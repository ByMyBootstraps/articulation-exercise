# Rule:
True iff the input contains the substring 'widdershins' (non-contrastive)

system:
Your objective is to learn an unknown function by observing input, ouput pairs.
To that end, you will be given a series of examples in the format {input: output}

Then, you will be given a new input. Your task is to predict the output corresponding to that input.
Your response must follow the format:

system:
Your objective is to learn an unknown function by observing input, ouput pairs.
To that end, you will be given a series of examples in the format {input: output}
    
Then, you will output a description of your top hypothesis for what the rule is.

What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) The rule could be that the output is True if the input sentence is a quote from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, and False otherwise. The first example is an excerpt from this poem, while the second example seems not to be.
1) The rule could be that any input containing the word "mark" is True, while any input that does not contain this word is False.
2) The rule is: If the sentence contains the word "mark" then the output is True, otherwise the output is False.
3) The rule seems to be that sentences containing the word "mark" are labeled as True, while those without it are labeled as False.
4) The rule could be that the output is True if the sentence contains more than a certain number of words, and False if it contains fewer. The first sentence, which is long and intricate, returns True, while the shorter second sentence returns False.
5) The rule could be that the output is "True" if the input text contains comma-separated phrases, and "False" if there are no such phrases in the input.
