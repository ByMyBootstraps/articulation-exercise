# Rule:
True iff the input contains the substring '-'

system:
Your objective is to learn an unknown function by observing input, ouput pairs.
To that end, you will be given a series of examples in the format {input: output}

Then, you will be given a new input. Your task is to predict the output corresponding to that input.
Your response must follow the format:

What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) The function determines whether the text provided contains a semicolon (';'). If the text contains a semicolon, the function returns True. If it does not, it returns False.
1) The rule seems to determine whether the sentence is from a classic literature novel (marked as True) or from another type of text (marked as False). The sentences marked as True seem to contain complex language and punctuation, characteristic of classic literature. The sentences marked as False, however, seems to come from potentially scriptural or religious texts.
2) The rule could be that the sentences that have a semicolon ";" in them are assigned true, whereas the ones that do not have a semicolon are assigned false.
3) The rule might be determining whether a sentence contains a semicolon (;). Sentences with a semicolon return True, and those without return False.
4) The rule could be that if the text is a sentence from a work of fiction or novel, then the output is True. If the text is from a religious text or scripture, the output is False.
5) The rule could be that the sentence is labeled as "True" if it includes a semicolon (";"), otherwise it is labeled as "False".
