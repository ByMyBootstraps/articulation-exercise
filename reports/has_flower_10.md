What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) The rule seems to be related to the presence of flowers or related elements (trees, gardens, flower-beds, etc.) in the sentence. If a sentence has a reference to flowers, trees, gardens, etc., the output is 'True'. If it does not have any such reference, the output is 'False'.
1) The rule seems to be that the output is True if the sentence contains mention of a flower, plant, garden, or related term. If there are no such references, the output is False.
2) The rule seems to be that the statement is True if it contains any reference or mention of flowers or organisms commonly associated with flowers, such as trees or grass. If there is no such mention, the statement is False.
3) The rule seems to be that the sentences are marked as 'True' when they contain some form of plants or flowers, and 'False' otherwise.
4) The rule seems to be that the statements that mention flowers or plants in some way are marked as true, while those that don't mention any flowers or plants are marked as false.
5) The rule seems to be that the statement is marked as "True" if it mentions flowers or a garden.
