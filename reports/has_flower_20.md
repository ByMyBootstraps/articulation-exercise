What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) The rule seems to be: the output is True if the input (text) mentions flowers, gardens, or related terms explicitly. The output is False if such terms are not mentioned.
1) The rule seems to be that sentences are marked as True if they contain a reference to flowers or gardening, and False otherwise.
2) The rule seems to be that sentences are labeled as True when they contain a reference to flowers, flower beds, or gardening. If the sentence does not mention these things, it is labeled as False.
3) The rule seems to be that whenever the input text mentions anything related to plants or flowers (like "flower", "garden", "flower-bed", etc), the output is True. If the text has no relation to plants or flowers, the output is False.
4) The rule seems to be that the sentences which contain references to flowers or gardening are marked as "True", and those which do not contain any references to flowers or gardening are marked as "False". Therefore, the function seems to be identifying sentences relevant to flowers or gardening.
5) The rule seems to be that the statement is marked as true if it includes some mention or reference to flowers, trees, or gardening. Statements that lack these elements are marked as false.
