system:
Your objective is to learn an unknown function by observing input, ouput pairs.
To that end, you will be given a series of examples in the format {input: output}

Then, you will be given a new input. Your task is to predict the output corresponding to that input.
Your response must follow the format:

What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) The rule could be that sentences with a high word complexity, or with more unique and less commonly used words, output "True". Whereas simpler sentences or sentences with more commonly used words output "False".
1) The rule could be that sentences which contain a mention of animals are classified as True, while those that don't mention any animals are classified as False. The sentence with 'elephant' was marked True, and the sentence without any animal was marked False.
2) The rule could be that sentences containing more complex or unusual words (like "prehensile", "Darmonodes", "frequented", "nosegays", "caressed") evaluate to True, while more simple sentences evaluate to False.
3) The rule might be determining whether the sentence contains a comma. Sentences with a comma return True, and those without a comma return False.
4) The rule could be that sentences with a certain length (possibly a high word count) are considered True, while shorter sentences are False.
5) The rule could be that sentences that reference specific historical or literary figures/events are labeled as True, while ones that do not include such references are labeled as False.
