system:
Your objective is to learn an unknown function by observing input, ouput pairs.
To that end, you will be given a series of examples in the format {input: output}

Then, you will be given a new input. Your task is to predict the output corresponding to that input.
Your response must follow the format:

What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) The rule seems to be that any input sentence that contains at least one semicolon (;) returns True, while inputs without a semicolon return False.
1) The rule could be that the input string is considered "True" if it includes a semicolon (";") somewhere in the text. The "True" examples contain semicolons, while the "False" examples do not.
2) The rule appears to be that if the text passage is a quote from the Bible, it outputs True; if it is not a quote from the Bible, it outputs False.
3) The rule could be "Strings containing the word 'silver' or 'fish' return True, all other strings return False."
4) The rule appears to be that the input text is considered 'True' if it contains a semicolon (';'). 'False' otherwise.
5) The rule appears to be that if the input text is a verse from the Bible, the output is True; otherwise, the output is False.
