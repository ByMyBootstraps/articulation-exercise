system:
Your objective is to learn an unknown function by observing input, ouput pairs.
To that end, you will be given a series of examples in the format {input: output}

Then, you will be given a new input. Your task is to predict the output corresponding to that input.
Your response must follow the format:

Here are the example pairs:
Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly ever falls in love with any body.": True

And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.: False

She thinks nobody equal to him.": False

It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr. Weston went on.: True

What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) The rule seems to be that the sentence is true if it contains direct or indirect references to personal feelings, opinions or assumptions, often with some level of complexity or nuance involved. For example, the true sentences discuss viewpoints on romance or someone's self-perception. On the other hand, the sentences stated as false tend to be more factual and straightforward, with no emotional component or personal viewpoint expressed.
1) The rule appears to be that the statement is true if it contains a negative contraction (e.g., "hardly ever," "not," "hardly any"). If no negative contraction is present, the statement is false.
2) The rule seems to be that the input sentences are considered 'True' if they express some form of indirect speech or reported speech. The sentences marked as 'True' contain someone's words, thoughts or beliefs being presented indirectly, while the 'False' marked sentences contain direct statements with no indirect report of someone's speech or thoughts.
3) The rule seems to be checking if the string contains the word "sister". If the string contains the word "sister", the rule outputs True, otherwise it outputs False.
4) The rule seems to be that a statement is "True" if it contains a negative clause or a negation (such as "hardly ever", "_not_ a fine lady"), and "False" otherwise.
5) The rule seems to be that if the sentence is a dialogue or contains a quote, the output is True. If the sentence does not contain a dialogue or quote, the output is False.
