Your objective is to learn an unknown function by observing input, ouput pairs.
To that end, you will be given a series of examples in the format {input: output}

Then, you will be given a new input. Your task is to predict the output corresponding to that input.
Your response must follow the format:

What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) My hypothesis for the rule is that a sequence is considered True if it is in non-decreasing order, i.e., each number in the sequence is less than or equal to the one that follows it. If there's even a single instance where a number is greater than the following number, then the sequence is considered False.
1) The rule could be: The sequence is considered True if it either has three or more unique numbers and they are in ascending order until they are repeated, or it contains only two unique numbers and those numbers are also in ascending order until they are repeated.
2) The rule appears to be: The sequence is 'True' if numbers in the sequence are non-decreasing, meaning each number is equal to or bigger than the one before it. If the sequence decreases at any point (a number is smaller than the one before it), it is 'False'.
3) The rule appears to be: the sequence is true if it's arranged in ascending order with possible equal consecutive numbers.
4) My hypothesis for the rule is that the sequence is considered to be true if and only if every number is less than or equal to the number to its right. Which means the sequence is in non-descending order.
5) The rule could be that the sequence is considered "True" if the numbers are in non-decreasing order, meaning the series of numbers either remains the same or increases as it moves along. In other words, if for every pair of adjacent numbers, the latter is greater than or equal to the former, the output is "True". If there's even one instance where a number is smaller than the
