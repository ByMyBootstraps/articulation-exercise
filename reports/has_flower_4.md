system:
Your objective is to learn an unknown function by observing input, ouput pairs.
To that end, you will be given a series of examples in the format {input: output}

Then, you will be given a new input. Your task is to predict the output corresponding to that input.
Your response must follow the format:

said the stable boy, snatching the flower-pot out of Lawrence's trembling hands, and pulled him away from the door.: True

What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) The rule seems to be: if the statement contains a comma-separated list (or more than one action or event), it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
1) The rule appears to be that sentences with a comma-separated list of more than two independent activities or descriptions are marked as True, those without are marked as False.
2) The rule seems to be: sentences are marked as True if they depict a direct or indirect interaction between a person and an object, while others are marked as False.
3) The rule appears to be: An output is True if the input sentence has a narrative style or vivid description, suggesting a story or event taking place, such as interactions or physical movements of characters. If the sentence is a plain statement, description or subjective opinion, it outputs False.
4) The rule appears to be: The sentence is True if it describes a scene with multiple characters interacting, involving tactile or physical actions, and is a narrative statement instead of a direct speech or a simple command or statement.
5) The function returns True if the sentence depicts a physical action or interaction, and False if the sentence does not.
