What is your hypothesis for the rule?

# Rule Predictions:
0) The rule seems to be that statements are true if they are in a prose style with markers of dialogue and/or multiple sentences, while simpler sentences, poetry and scripture verses without dialogue markers are false.
1) The function returns True for inputs where the speaker is engaged in an emotionally charged, personal, or intimate conversation, often featuring introspective or emotional content, concerns, or dialogue. The function returns False for inputs that are either impersonal, factual, formal, or concerned with external actions or events.
2) The rule appears to be that sentences which involve direct dialogue or quoted speech are labeled as "True", while those without direct dialogue are labeled "False". More specifically, the presence of dialogues seems to be punctuated by either double quotes (" ") or two consecutive hyphens (--), indicating a speech or dialogue.
3) The rule seems to be that any sentence that contains direct speech or dialogue is classified as True, while any sentence that does not contain dialogue is classified as False. The presence of quotation marks (" ") indicating spoken words or conversation appears to be the determining factor.
4) The rule appears to be: sentences containing dialogue or direct speech are labeled as True, while those without dialogue are labeled as False.
5) The rule appears to be based on the use of dialogues or conversations in the text. If a sentence contains direct spoken dialogue using quotation marks, it is marked as True. If a sentence is descriptive and does not contain any dialogue, it is marked as False.
