Ok. I do not have very much time.
Plan:
- make a list of 2 dozen boring classification rules
    - number structure
    - sentence structure
    - sentiment
    - basic indicators like "contains the word flower"
    - ... other things ...
- probably use GPT-4 to effortlessly generate code for generating and scoring examples
- generate examples and stick them into various scaffoldings and see whether GPT-4 can learn them
- ask GPT-4 to articulate the rule in various scaffoldings
- write up my results
- (record transcripts...)

- test fancy things like the rule is evaluations made by GPT-4, can it learn it?


OK. Finish doing my chosen tests. Possibly change all text matching to do whole-word matching.
Add contrastive datasets.

Start testing faithfulness.
Start doing my official write-up.

Implement some prompting variants.





Ok. I'm going to test faithfulness. And then try to run some contrastive datasets for things that didn't succeed the first time around.
